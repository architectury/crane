# Crane
Crane is a set of extensions to Mojang's official Minecraft obfuscation mappings, providing things such as parameter names and Javadocs not supplied by the original mappings set.

________
Crane is built on the same foundation as Yarn, with gui-based mappings via [Enigma](https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma).

### Contributing

Run `gradlew run` to launch Enigma, edit and save the mappings, and open a pull request.
